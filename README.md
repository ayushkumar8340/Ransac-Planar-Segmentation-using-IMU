# RANSAC Planar Segmentation using IMU

This repository implements a gravity-aligned RANSAC-based plane segmentation algorithm that integrates IMU data to improve plane fitting performance. The key idea is to guide the RANSAC plane hypothesis generation using the gravity direction estimated from an IMU, which stabilizes and accelerates convergence in real-world applications like SLAM or robotics.

## DEMO
